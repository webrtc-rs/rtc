//! DTLS 1.2 for the Sans-I/O WebRTC stack.
//!
//! An implementation of Datagram Transport Layer Security ([RFC 6347]) with the extensions
//! WebRTC requires: DTLS-SRTP key export ([RFC 5764]), extended master secret
//! ([RFC 7627]), and elliptic-curve cipher suites ([RFC 4492], [RFC 5289]). It secures the
//! media and data-channel path: SRTP keying material comes out of the DTLS handshake, and
//! SCTP data channels run over the DTLS association itself.
//!
//! # Structure
//!
//! * [`endpoint`] — the Sans-I/O entry point: feed it datagrams, poll it for the datagrams
//!   it wants to send and the events it produces. No sockets, no timers of its own.
//! * [`config`] — certificates, cipher-suite and curve preferences, the client/server role,
//!   and the SRTP protection profiles to negotiate.
//! * [`handshake`], [`flight`], [`state`] — the handshake message types and the flight state
//!   machine that drives them, including retransmission.
//! * [`cipher_suite`], [`crypto`], [`curve`], [`signature_hash_algorithm`] — the
//!   cryptographic primitives and the negotiated-suite abstraction.
//! * [`extension`] — the ClientHello/ServerHello extensions, including `use_srtp` and SNI.
//! * [`alert`], [`content`], [`record_layer`] — the record layer and its content types.
//!
//! Most applications do not depend on this crate directly — the
//! [`rtc`](https://docs.rs/rtc) crate drives it as one layer of the peer-connection
//! pipeline.
//!
