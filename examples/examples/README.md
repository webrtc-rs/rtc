All examples are ported from [Pion](https://github.com/pion/webrtc/tree/master/examples#readme). Please
check [Pion Examples](https://github.com/pion/webrtc/tree/master/examples#readme) for more details:

### Data Channel API

- ✅ [Data Channels](data-channels): The data-channels example shows how you can send/recv DataChannel messages from a
  web browser.
- ✅ [Data Channels Create](data-channels-create): Example data-channels-create shows how you can send/recv DataChannel
  messages from a web browser. The difference with the data-channels example is that the data channel is initialized
  from the server side in this example.
- ✅ [Data Channels Close](data-channels-close): Example data-channels-close is a variant of data-channels that allow
  playing with the life cycle of data channels.
- ✅ [Data Channels Flow Control](data-channels-flow-control): Example data-channels-flow-control shows how to use flow
  control.
- ✅ [Data Channels Offer Answer](data-channels-offer-answer): Example offer-answer is an example of two webrtc-rs
  instances communicating directly!
- [ ] [Data Channels Simple](TODO): Simple example of a WebRTC DataChannel using it as the signaling server.
- [ ] [Data Channels WHIP WHEP](TODO): This example demonstrates a WHIP/WHEP-like implementation using WebRTC with
  DataChannel support for real-time chat.

### Media API

- ✅ [Reflect](reflect): The reflect example demonstrates how to have webrtc-rs send back to the user exactly what it
  receives using the same PeerConnection.
- ✅ [Play from Disk VPx](play-from-disk-vpx): The play-from-disk-vpx example demonstrates how to send VP8/VP9 video to
  your browser from a file saved to disk.
- ✅ [Play from Disk H26x](play-from-disk-h264): The play-from-disk-h26x example demonstrates how to send H264/H265 video
  to your browser from a file saved to disk.
- ✅ [Play from Disk Renegotiation](play-from-disk-renegotiation): The play-from-disk-renegotiation example is an
  extension of the play-from-disk example, but demonstrates how you can add/remove video tracks from an already
  negotiated PeerConnection.
- ✅ [Save to Disk VPx](save-to-disk-vpx): The save-to-disk-vpx example shows how to record your webcam and save the
  footage (VP8/VP9 for video, Opus for audio) to disk on the server side.
- ✅ [Save to Disk H26x](save-to-disk-h26x): The save-to-disk-h26x example shows how to record your webcam and save the
  footage (H264/H265 for video, Opus for audio) to disk on the server side.
- [ ] [Insertable Streams](insertable-streams): The insertable-streams example demonstrates how webrtc-rs can be used to
  send E2E encrypted video and decrypt via insertable streams in the browser.
- [ ] [Broadcast](broadcast): The broadcast example demonstrates how to broadcast a video to multiple peers. A
  broadcaster uploads the video once and the server forwards it to all other peers.
- [ ] [RTP Forwarder](rtp-forwarder): The rtp-forwarder example demonstrates how to forward your audio/video streams
  using RTP.
- [ ] [RTP to WebRTC](rtp-to-webrtc): The rtp-to-webrtc example demonstrates how to take RTP packets sent to a webrtc-rs
  process into your browser.
- [ ] [Simulcast](simulcast): The simulcast example demonstrates how to accept and demux 1 Track that contains 3
  Simulcast streams. It then returns the media as 3 independent Tracks back to the sender.
- [ ] [Swap Tracks](swap-tracks): The swap-tracks demonstrates how to swap multiple incoming tracks on a single outgoing
  track.
- [ ] [RTCP Processing](TODO) The rtcp-processing example demonstrates RTCP APIs. This allows access to media statistics
  and control information.
- [ ] [Save to Disk AV1](TODO): The save-to-disk-av1 is a simple application that shows how to save a video to disk
  using AV1.
- [ ] [Play from Disk FEC](TODO): The play-from-disk-fec demonstrates how to use forward error correction (FlexFEC-03)
  while sending video to your Chrome-based browser from files saved to disk. The example is designed to drop 40% of the
  media packets, but browser will recover them using the FEC packets and the delivered packets.
- [ ] [Play from Disk Playlist Control](TODO): Streams Opus pages from multi or single track Ogg containers, exposes the
  playlist over an SCTP DataChannel, and lets the browser hop between tracks while showing artist/title metadata parsed
  from OpusTags.

### Miscellaneous

- ✅ [ICE Restart](ice-restart): The ice-restart demonstrates webrtc-rs ICE Restart abilities.
- [ ] [ICE Single Port](TODO) Example ice-single-port demonstrates how multiple WebRTC connections can be served from a
  single port. By default, it listens on a new port for every PeerConnection. webrtc-rs can be configured to use a
  single
  port for multiple connections.
- [ ] [ICE TCP](TODO) Example ice-tcp demonstrates how a WebRTC connection can be made over TCP instead of UDP. By
  default,
  webrtc-rs only does UDP. webrtc-rs can be configured to use a TCP port, and this TCP port can be used for many
  connections.
- [ ] [ICE Proxy](TODO) Example ice-proxy demonstrates how to use a proxy for TURN connections.
- [ ] [Trickle ICE](TODO) Example trickle-ice example demonstrates WebRTC's Trickle ICE APIs. This is important to use
  since it allows ICE Gathering and Connecting to happen concurrently.
- [ ] [Stats](TODO): Stats demonstrates how to use the webrtc-stats implementation provided by WebRTC-rs.
- [ ] [WHIP WHEP](TODO): The whip-whep demonstrates using WHIP and WHEP with webrtc-rs. Since WHIP+WHEP is standardized
  signaling you can publish via tools like OBS and GStreamer. You can then watch it in sub-second time from your
  browser, or pull the video back into OBS and GStreamer via WHEP.
