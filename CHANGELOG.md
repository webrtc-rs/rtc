## [Unreleased]

### Added

-

### Changed

- **`MediaEngine::register_default_codecs` no longer registers `video/ulpfec`**
  ([#837](https://github.com/webrtc-rs/webrtc/issues/837)). The receive path does not recover
  media from ULPFEC packets, so offering the codec invited peers to send repair packets that
  could not be used. Applications that want it can still register it explicitly with
  `MIME_TYPE_ULP_FEC`, which remains public. **This changes the default offer's SDP**: payload
  type 116 is no longer present. ULPFEC will return to the defaults once receive-side recovery
  is implemented.

### Deprecated

-

### Removed

- Removed the partial `openssl` and `vendored-openssl` Cargo features from `rtc-srtp` and `rtc`; SRTP cryptography now uses the selected `rtc-crypto` provider for every protection profile.

### Fixed

- Add RSA as an allowed private key kind in rtc_dtls::ConfigBuilder::
  validate- [PR #141](https://github.com/webrtc-rs/rtc/pull/141)
